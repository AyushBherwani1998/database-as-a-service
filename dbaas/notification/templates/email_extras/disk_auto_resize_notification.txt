Database {{database.name}} disk was resized

The Database {{database.name}} in {{database.environment}} environment was almost full ({{usage_percentage}}% in use).

We automatically did the disk resize to {{new_disk_offering}}.

You are receiving this email because in our records you are in team {{ database.team.name }}.
If this is not right, contact the DBaaS system administrators.
